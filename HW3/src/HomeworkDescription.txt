GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------
Your task is to define a class with one method, described below.

Your class must be defined in a named package placed in the 'src' folder.
You may NOT name the package 'tests' or 'util', but aside from that any
valid Java package name is acceptable.

You may choose any valid Java class name for your class.

You may choose any valid Java method names for your methods.  Your methods may
be either static or non-static, but if non-static your class must provide a 
no-argument constructor (either the default constructor, or an explicit one).

The functionality of your definitions will be verified by JUnit tests.
IMPORTANT: note that if the methods are simply stubbed out (just return true or
false) then the all the tests for that method will fail.  You must provide a
non-stub implementation in order for the tests to have a chance of passing.

HOMEWORK-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------

A description of the required (public) method:

/**************************************************************************
 * @param  a String denoting the inputPath the path on the local filesystem
 *         to the input file
 * @return a HashMap<String,String> of name:telephone number mappings, as
 *         described below.
 *
 * The file will contain names and telephone numbers, in the format indicated
 * by this example:
 * 
 * Anna:645-3180
 * Bob Smith:1-905-645-3181x1294
 * Miss Christina R. Jones:+011-46-017-364388
 * 
 * Each line contains only one name and only one telephone number.  The name
 * consists of all the characters from the start of the line to the colon
 * character, ':'.  The telephone number consists of all the characters after
 * the colon character to the end of the line (which will always be denoted by
 * a newline character, '\n').
 *
 * The first name:telephone number combination will appear on the first line
 * the file.  The last name:telephone number combination will appear on the
 * last line of the file (terminated by a newline character).  There will be
 * no blank lines in the input file.  Note that since telephone numbers can
 * contain characters other than digits, they must be read and stored as Strings.
 * 
 * You must use only CharacterFromFileReader to read characters from the input
 * file.
 * 
 * In order to keep your code readable, break your code into several methods.
 * Define meaningful private helper methods that you call from the required
 * public method.
