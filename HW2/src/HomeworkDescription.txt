CSE116 HW2

Your task is to define a class with exactly one public method, described below.

Your class must be defined in a named package placed in the 'src' folder.
You may NOT name the package 'tests' or 'util', but aside from that any
valid Java package name is acceptable.

You may choose any valid Java class name for your class.

You may choose any valid Java method names for your methods.  Your methods may
be either static or non-static, but if non-static your class must provide a 
no-argument constructor (either the default constructor, or an explicit one).

The functionality of your definitions will be verified by JUnit tests.
IMPORTANT: note that if the methods are simply stubbed out (just return true or
false) then the all the tests for that method will fail.  You must provide a
non-stub implementation in order for the tests to have a chance of passing.

A description of the required method:

/**************************************************************************
 * @param s is the original String (the sole parameter of the method)
 * @return an int[] of size 3, containing the character counts as described 
 * below.
 *
 * Definitions:
 *
 * [letter] A character ch is a letter if and only if
 *          ( 'a' <= ch AND ch <= 'z' ) OR ( 'A' <= ch AND ch <= 'Z' )  
 *
 * [vowel]  The following characters are vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u',
 *          as are their upper-case equivalents: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O' and 'U'.
 *
 * [consonant] A letter which is not a vowel is a consonant.
 *
 * [non-alphabetic] Any character which is not a letter is a non-alphabetic
 *          character.
 *
 * The count of vowel characters must be in position 0 of the array,
 * the count of consonant characters must be in position 1 of the array, and
 * the count of all non-alphabetic characters must be in position 2 of the array.
 * 
 * Some examples:
 * 
 * if s is "", then:
 *     all entries in the array must be 0.
 * if s is "a", then:
 *     all entries in the array must be 0 except for entry 0, which must be 1.
 * if s is "Baaa!", then:
 *     entry 0 of the array must be 3 (because there are three vowels)
 *     entry 1 of the array must be 1 (because there is one consonant), and
 *     entry 2 of the array must be 1 (because there is one non-alphabetic character).
 * 
 * The only methods you may call on the String s are charAt(int) and length().
 *
 * You may use the static toLowerCase method defined in the Character class,
 * which maps a char to its lower-case equivalent.  For example,
 *     Character.toLowerCase('a') returns 'a'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('A') returns 'A'
 *     Character.toLowerCase('%') returns '%'
 * 
 * You may, if you wish, define private helper methods that you call from your
 * character counting method.
